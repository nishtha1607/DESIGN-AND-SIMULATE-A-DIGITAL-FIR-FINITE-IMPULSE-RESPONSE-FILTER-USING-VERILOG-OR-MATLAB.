*DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED*/ 

**Digital FIR Filter Design Using Verilog**
Description
This repository contains the design and simulation of a digital Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog. The FIR filter processes digital signals to perform tasks such as noise reduction, signal smoothing, and signal extraction. The repository includes the Verilog code, a testbench to verify functionality, simulation results, and a performance analysis.
This project involves designing and implementing a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter using Verilog. The filter was tested and simulated in Xilinx Vivado, and its performance was verified using MATLAB. The images below show the original sine wave, the bitstream converted to an analog signal, and the filtered sine wave.

**Technologies used:**
Verilog: Used for designing the FIR filter.

Xilinx Vivado: Used for simulating and testing the Verilog design.

MATLAB: Used for generating the sine wave, converting bitstreams to analog signals, and visualizing the results.

**FIR Filter Details**
The FIR filter implemented here is a simple moving average filter with 4 taps. The filter coefficients are initialized to perform averaging.

**Testbench**
The testbench provides a set of test cases to verify the FIR filter's functionality. It applies a sequence of input samples and monitors the filtered output.

Simulation Report
The simulation report  contains the output of the FIR filter for different input samples, demonstrating the correctness of the design.

Performance Analysis
The performance analysis  includes an assessment of the FIR filter's performance, including factors such as speed, accuracy, and resource utilization.
